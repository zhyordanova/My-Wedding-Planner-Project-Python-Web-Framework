                        gave great suggestions and was always just an email or call away when we had any last minute
                        questions. On the day of our wedding, she did a phenomenal of job making the venue look
                        absolutely beautiful and captured the exact theme and feel that we were going for. I truly could
                        not have made it through the day without her!"</p>
